# Shared Context — AI Workflow

This is the append-only thinking context shared by all agents. Each agent writes a structured entry when they begin or end work.

**Format:**
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] @agent — Task: <task-id>
**Thinking**: <key ideas, decisions, rationale>
**Decisions Made**: <list>
**Handoff Notes**: <for next agent in pipeline>
```

## INIT @paos-init — Task: PAOS-FRESH-START

**Thinking**: PAOS was freshly initialized via bin/init-paos.sh. All old session data has been cleared. The system is starting clean with only PAOS itself as the active project.

**Decisions**:
- All previous session data, ledger entries, task cards, pipelines, inbox messages, and event logs have been reset
- The only active project is PAOS itself — enhancing the PAOS framework
- See HANDOFF.md for the current state

**Handoff Notes**: Welcome to a fresh PAOS. Read HANDOFF.md first, then pick up where you like.
